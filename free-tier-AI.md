# Azure Services: Free Tier
## _Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence_

It can be difficult to navigate pricing structures for machine learning and artificial intelligence services – especially if you’re only interested in free offerings, after the 30- or 90-day trials end. Below is a detailed listing of Azure free-tier AI and ML services, as of Monday, November 6th, 2017. Please note that many of these services may only be offered in specific regions (East US 2 being most common). I also encourage you to look at the [full list of free Azure offerings](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
